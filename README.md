**Submission guidelines:**  

After finalizing your project, a submission can be made by inviting a collaborator to your personal repository (make sure you have the privileges to do that). The collaborator should be the TA that has been assigned to your group on the following spreadsheet: http://shorturl.at/fjtyQ . 
You’re expected to submit your project on Canvas as well by providing a URL of your git repository.


**How to create a Pull request**

1. Open your git repository

2. Click on Pull requests, then click on the green button that says “new pull request”.
You’ll come to a page that says “Compare changes”.

3. Choose branches.
To create a pull request, you want to set the base and compare branches to the following:
base repository: S2-group/software-design-vu
base: master
head repository: "yourname"/software-design-vu
compare: branch you want to merge from (ex. if you worked from master branch, then choose master)

4. Once you’ve selected your branches, Github will ask you to writte a title and a comment. Writte your group number in the title.

You'll see a list of commits that have been made by you.
If you've followed the steps correctly, Github will show you a page that says “Open a pull request”.
This is how you create a pull request.
